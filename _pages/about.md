I am Dr.-Ing. Daniel-André Dücker, Senior Scientist at the Munich Institute of Robotics and Machine Intelligence (MIRMI), Technical University of Munich, where I lead the Environmental Robotics group. My research focuses on localization, control, and learning methods for underwater and field robotic systems, with applications in environmental monitoring. I have held research positions at TU Hamburg and as Visiting Scientist at MIT’s Marine Autonomy Lab and Sea Grant. 
My work has been recognized with awards such as a Dissertation Award, and the Deutsches Maritimes Zentrum Teaching Award, an IROS Best Paper in Amusement and Entertainment Award.
